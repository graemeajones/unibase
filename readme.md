    ~Hello World!

This is my initial commit and push to the unibase backend web API repository. 
My aim is to slowly disect the code, and learn the ins and outs of backend
development using node and express JS.

By the end of this project, i hope to:

    1. Understand node and express JS, how the API endpoints are created 
    and how they interract with the backend database.

    2. Manage and add new endpoints as well as entites, relations and 
    attributes for each of the group projects.

    3. Divide each project and its databse into a separate reposotory/database
    in preparation fopr the deployment phase.
